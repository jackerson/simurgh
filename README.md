## Overview

#### Description
Simurgh is a learning source compiler that presents you with a collage of resources that help you get starting in your journey towards researching a new topic.

#### Vision Statement
Learners for any field have a plethora of information available to them on the internet. However, filtering out irrelevancy and inaccuracy is one of the biggest barriers in trying to make sense of this information. With Sigmurgh, learners will be able to enter their new interest with a tighter and more refined list of links to articles, papers, tutorials, videos, and more.

#### Motivation
Learning anything is hard; not because of lack of information, but because of too much. The ability to fitler out what's a good source and what isn't can be a huge game-changer in a world where the ability to learn any topic or skill is at our fingertips at every given moment.

#### Risks
1) Figuring out a way to generate sources for any given topic
2) Planning consistent meeting times
3) Picking up on gaps in our knowledge in web development

#### Risk Mitigation Plan
1) Discussion with professors on machine learning algorithms
2) Giving as many updates on our Slack channel so everyone is aware of what our progress is if not every member is able to attend a particular meeting.
3) Online tutorials and the CS department

#### Version Control
We are using GitHub as our version control method because it is the only system that all of our teammates are familiar with.

#### Development Method
Our group is going to use the Agile methodology.

#### Collaboration Tool
We've chosen to use Slack to communication throughout this project.
